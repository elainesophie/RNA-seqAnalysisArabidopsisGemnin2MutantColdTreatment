# RNA-seqAnalysisArabidopsisGemnin2MutantColdTreatment
In this project, I use edgeR and voom to analyze Arabidopsis RNA-seq data. I identified similar number of differentially expressed genes with the author. I use AgriGO and Ami GO2 online tools to do GO enrichment analysis, and observe similar significant GO terms with the author. I also partly repeat one of the comparisons done by the author, the result partially support the author’s conclusion that there is a strong overlap between the effects of cold conditions on pre- mRNA splicing events in wild-type plants and the effects of GEMIN2 on pre-mRNA splicing events at 22 °C.
